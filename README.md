Protractor Testing Guidelines
============================

Some opinionated guidelines for those out there, looking for testing best practices with protractor

## Nota Bene
These guidelines were written having strictly AngularJS applications in mind....

## Testing

When it comes to testing AngularJS applications, there are two main types of tests you want to cover: unit and e2e
tests (mind you the "AND" not the "OR" ;)). Both are equally important, so if you care at all about the sanity of your
application, and, why not admit it, yours too, then writing unit and e2e tests will hold an important place in your
process.

#### Unit Testing

Unit tests are your first line of defence against bugs and errors in your code. They ensure that the smallest parts
of your code, the units, work as intended, by testing them in complete isolation from the rest of the application. If you
think of your application as the process of building a car, unit testing would be taking each car part, like the wheels,
or the engine, separately, and checking whether they work as intended, independently from the other parts of the car.

It is important to remember the "in complete isolation" aspect of unit testing. Instantiating services, making API calls,
or even worse, instantiating the entire system (all very expensive operations), in order to test just one single
unit, is unnecessary and not something that you want to have in your unit tests. The general rule of thumb is to mock
any external dependencies of the unit under test.

There are many more things to say about unit testing, and there are even some [links](#useful-links) to help you out
with that, but since the subject is outside the scope of this article, let's leave it to that, and oh well, one example,
just for the peace of mind of it ;)

```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // add example here
```

#### E2E Testing

E2E tests come into play once all units are fully tested and you want to start looking into how these components play
together. In other words, you will want to make sure that once your end user starts interacting with your application
and clicks his/her way through it, it will behave as expected and not }:) output :o all sort o/ of funny :P smileys
everywhere ;).

Coming back to our previous car example, e2e testing would mean checking that all components of the car integrate well
with each other and have the expected behavior as an overall, so for instance that the break lights turn on when the
driver steps on the breaks or that the wheels start turning when the driver steps on the acceleration pedal, and so on.

Again, it is very important to keep in mind that e2e tests are black-box tests and only care about the functionality of
the application from an end user point of view. Whether or not the services around the application work properly, or that
responses from the server are correct, and so on, is outside the scope of e2e testing and should be handled as separate
tests, which we will not cover in this article. Rule of thumb is again to mock all these dependencies.

//TODO add mention here that ppl could also let all the calls go through
// make clear that ppl understand that the point of e2e testing is not to test your services and api calls but rather
//the user interaction of your app
// run tests against mocks

## Protractor

If you've been in the Angular world for long enough, you'll probably remember about the [Angular Scenario Runner]
(https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.16/docs/guide/e2e-testing). The Scenario Runner was originally shipped with Angular as a
tool to help developers e2e test their application. However, due to some design and maintenance issues, the team decided
to not continue with its development and provide a better solution on the long term. Currently, the Angular Scenario
Runner is deprecated and in maintenance mode, so in case you are using it in your application, you might want to
reconsider.

The "new" tool for e2e testing your AngularJS application is Protractor. Protractor is an e2e test framework built on top
of WebDriverJS, which adds some Angular-specific functionality.

// TODO what more do we want to say here?

**One word of advice!** New versions of Protractor can sometimes come with breaking changes, which might, well, break
your tests. Make sure to ALWAYS read the changelog before updating to a newer or the latest version!

### One config file to rule them all

  - Create one protractor.conf.js file. You can create spin-offs using grunt (or an other task runner).

Any protractor test suite starts out with a protractor.conf.js file, which basically is, as the name suggests,
configuration code for protractor written out in javascript. When you want to test different test tasks (targets), its
easy to create copies of the conf file. You shouldn't do that. Just because a file contains config, doesn't mean that it
isn't code and thus you should treat it as if it is production code. Code duplication is not acceptable.

## Page Objects

As mentioned earlier, e2e tests cover the interaction scenarios between the end user and your application. This works by
having the test code simulate a series of user actions against certain UI parts of your application and then making some
assertions regarding what the expected result of those actions should be.

So let's assume we have a very simple application that can answer any possible question. Let's call it the "Grandfather
of All Knowledge" app. The idea of the app is pretty straightforward: the user enters a question in an input field,
presses a button and gets the answer to the question. Easy! ... and clever if you get the right answer ;)

The HTML markup for the application would look something like this:

```html
<!-- grandfather.html -->

<body ng-app="GrandfatherOfAllKnowledgeApp">
  <div class="question">
    <input class="question__field" ng-model="question.text"
           placeholder="What would you like to ask Grandfather of all knowledge?">
    <button class="question-button" ng-click="answerQuestion()"
            ng-disabled="!question.text">?</button>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">{{answer}}</div>
</body>
  ```

The e2e tests in this case should cover exactly the interaction we described earlier: user enters question, presses
button and gets an answer. They would look something like this:

```javascript
/* grandfatherSpec.js */

describe("The grandfather of all knowledge module", function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    browser.get('/#/grandfather-of-all-knowledge');
  });

  it('should answer any question', function() {
    var question = element(by.model('question.text'));
    var answer = element(by.binding('answer'));
    var button = element(by.css('.question-button'));

    question.sendKeys("What is the purpose of meaning?");
    button.click();
    expect(answer.getText()).toEqual("Chocolate!");
  });

  it('should not answer empty questions', function() {
    var question = element(by.model('question.text'));
    var answer = element(by.binding('answer'));
    var button = element(by.css('.question-button'));

    question.sendKeys("    ");
    expect(button.isEnabled()).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
```

Now, the fact that we are declaring the question/answer/button elements in each spec, adds a lot of duplicate code to our
tests, and as we all know, duplicate code means we're doing something not quite right. Let's fix that!

```javascript
/* grandfatherSpec.js */

describe("The grandfather of all knowledge module", function() {

  var question = element(by.model('question.text'));
  var answer = element(by.binding('answer'));
  var button = element(by.css('.question-button'));

  beforeEach(function() {
    browser.get('/#/grandfather-of-all-knowledge');
  });

  it('should answer any question', function() {
    question.sendKeys("What is the purpose of meaning?");
    button.click();
    expect(answer.getText()).toEqual("Chocolate!");
  });

  it('should not answer empty questions', function() {
    question.sendKeys("    ");
    expect(button.isEnabled()).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
```

This is already better, but we can do even better than that. If you look at the tests we wrote, notice that they are
dealing with multiple concerns at the same time: keeping track of the page under test, selecting elements from that page,
defining the interaction with these elements, making the assertions and so on. Furthermore, imagine that the markup of
the tested page changes, so for instance the class of our button would change from "question-button" to just simply
"button". This would mean that we would have to revisit all the places in our tests where we declared the button and make
sure its selector uses the correct class name. For large code bases, but not even, this is simply not maintainable and
for sure not something you want to worry about.

This is precisely the point where **Page Objects** will come to the rescue. Page Object is a design pattern that is largely
used in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication [(5)](#page-objects-1). Think of a
Page Object as the API of the UI your tests interact with. Page Objects are responsible of abstracting away the
implementation details of your UI from your tests, and simply provide an interface which should allow a software client
do anything and see anything the user can [(7)](#page-objects-1).

Coming back to our Grandfather of all Knowledge application, let's see how a Page Object would look like:

```javascript
/* grandfatherPageObject.js */

var GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge = function() {
  this.question = element(by.model('question.text'));
  this.answer = element(by.binding('answer'));
  this.button = element(by.css('.question-button'));
};

GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge.prototype.askQuestion = function(question) {
  this.question.sendKeys(question);
  this.button.click();  
};

GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge.prototype.getAnswer = function() {
  return this.answer.getText();
}

module.exports = GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge;
```

```javascript
/* grandfatherSpec.js */

var GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge = require('./grandfatherPageObject');

describe("The grandfather of all knowledge module", function() {

  var grandfatherOfAllKnowledge = new GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge();

  beforeEach(function() {
    browser.get('/#/grandfather-of-all-knowledge');
  });

  it('should answer any question', function() {
    grandfatherOfAllKnowledge.askQuestion("What is the purpose of meaning?");
    expect(grandfatherOfAllKnowledge.getAnswer()).toEqual("Chocolate!");
  });

  it('should not answer empty questions', function() {
    grandfatherOfAllKnowledge.askQuestion("    ");
    expect(grandfatherOfAllKnowledge.getAnswer()).toEqual("");
    expect(grandfatherOfAllKnowledge.button.isEnabled()).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
```

Much cleaner right? So now, with a proper Page Object in place, we can just focus on writing our tests, without worrying
that we have to run around fixing them every time the HTML markup under test changes. The only thing to take care of is
keeping the Page Object definition in sync with its corresponding part of the UI.

With these basic concepts out of the way, time for some Page Object related best practices ;)


#### Rule PO-001
  * *UpperCamelCase* the names of your Page Objects

  **Why?:** Because by definition, a Page Object is an object-oriented class and therefore all class naming conventions
  apply to it

    ```javascript
      /* avoid */
      var grandfatherOfAllKnowledge = function() {/*...*/};
      var grandfather-of-all-knowledge = function() {/*...*/};
      var grandfather_of_all_knowledge = function() {/*...*/};
    ```

    ```javascript
      /* recommended */
      var GrandfatherOfAllKnowledge = function() {
        /*...*/
      };
    ```
#### Rule PO-002 (?)
  * Pick a descriptive naming convention for your page Object files and stick with it

  **Why?:** This will ensure that your Page Object related files are easily recognisable and distinguishable from all
  the other files in the project.

   ```
      /* avoid */
        |-- test
            |-- unit
            |-- e2e
                |-- home
                    |-- home.js
                    |-- homeSpec.js
                |-- profile
                    |-- profile.js
                    |-- profileSpec.js
                |-- contacts
                    |-- contacts.js
                    |-- contactsSpec.js
                |-- archive
                    |-- archive.js
                    |-- archiveSpec.js
   ```

   ```
   /* recommended */
     |-- test
         |-- unit
         |-- e2e
             |-- home
                 |-- homePageObject.js
                 |-- homeSpec.js
             |-- profile
                 |-- profilePageObject.js
                 |-- profileSpec.js
             |-- contacts
                 |-- contactsPageObject.js
                 |-- contactsSpec.js
             |-- archive
                 |-- archivePageObject.js
                 |-- archiveSpec.js
   ```
#### Rule PO-003
  * Group your e2e tests and Page Object files in a structure that makes sense to the structure of your project. So for
  instance, if you are working on a small project and are using the old recommended scaffolding [(1)](#angularjs), group
  all your Page Object files in one folder, separately from the test files. However, if you are working on a larger scale
  project using the new recommended Angular app structure [(1)](#angularjs), you should group the spec and Page Object
  files per each section defined in your app structure.

  **Why?:** Because finding your test and Page Object files should be intuitive and easy to anyone working with the
  project.

#### Rule PO-004
  * Do not add any assertions in your Page Object definitions.

  **Why?:** Because, as Martin Fowler puts it:

    *Page objects are commonly used for testing, but should not make assertions themselves. Their responsibility is to
    provide access to the state of the underlying page. It's up to test clients to carry out the assertion logic.*
